# nats.io

This repository contains the source content for http://nats.io.
The [nats.io](http://nats.io) website is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework, and built from raw HTML and Markdown content using [Hugo](gohugo.io), a static site generator written in [Go](http://golang.org/).

This repository and the [documentation repository for the nats.io site](github.com/nats-io/nats-docs) share a [common CSS theme submodule](http://github.com/nats-io/nats-theme/).

## Contributing content

We view this project as a perpetual work in progress that can greatly benefit from and be enriched by the knowledge, wisdom and experience of our community.

We follow the standard Fork-and-Branch GitHub workflow.
If you're not familiar with this process, please refer to either of the following excellent guides:

- ['Forking Projects' GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
- ['Fork a Repo' GitHub Help article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

We encourage and welcome your contributions to any part or element of this site.
We will review and discuss with you any contributions or corrections submitted via GitHub Pull Request.


### Content Organization

The basic organization of the site is very simple, with each top navigation link corresponding to a single HTML or Markdown file in the `nats-site/content` directory.
The HTML documents and any Markdown documents contained in this directory are assembled by Hugo and rendered to static HTML during the build process.

### Adding pages

Any new page should be a raw HTML or Markdown document placed beneath the `content` directory. Each page added needs a header like the following:

```
+++
date = "2015-01-02"
title = "Title of Page"
+++
```

- Date format: Year-Month-Day
- Title: Title of the page

In the current design, adding a new page to the main menu requires adding that page's title to the `mainMenu` array in `config.toml`:

```
baseurl = "http://nats.io/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "NATS by Apcera"

[params]
  leftNav = false
  description = "NATS - NATS was created as a central nervous system for cloud native and distributed systems, and provides the foundation for modern, reliable, and scalable cloud and distributed systems."
  author = "The NATS team"
  mainMenu=[ "home", "download", "clients", "documentation", "support", "community" ]
```

### Adding Quotes and Logos to homepage
To add a new quote and logo to the homepage you are going to have to modify `/layouts/partials/quotes.html` and follow the convention as seen from the existing quotes.

If you have a logo to go along with the quote, just add a full size `.jpeg` or `.png` logo to `/src/user_logos`. Then run `gulp` in the terminal to generate the proper image size. Then link do the generated image in `static/img/user_logos`. Example: `<img src="/img/user_logos/FILENAME.EXT">`

### Adding Partner logo
To add a new partner logo to `/partners` you must add a large logo of either `.png` or `.jpeg` to `/src/partner_logos`. Then run `gulp` in the terminal to generate the proper image size. Then just link do the generated image in `static/img/partner_logos`. Example: `<img src="/img/partner_logos/FILENAME.EXT">`

*In order to run `gulp` you will have to run `npm install` in the root of the project to install all dependencies if you have not done so yet.*

## Style guidelines and conventions

### Markdown

- Use topic-based files and titles
- Use only headers 1 (#), 2 (##) and 3 (###)
- Use single spaces to separate sentences
- Markdown syntax: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img
	- Links: `[NATS](http://nats.io/)`
	- Cross references: `[Clients](/clients/)`
	- Images: `![drawing](/img/nats-msg.png)`
- Triple ticks for code, commands to run, user operations, input/output
- Single ticks for executable names, file paths, inline commands, parameters, etc.
- Graphics: save as `*.png`; source in `/src/img/nats-brokered-throughput-comparison.png`

### Everything else

The site is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework, and the content structure is designed to be simple, informative, intuitive and fast -- just like NATS!
Please keep these principles in mind as you modify existing content or design new content for the [nats.io](http://nats.io) site.

For more information on Bootstrap's themes, conventions, and content support (HTML/CSS/JS), please visit [the Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com).


## Checking your work

To make sure your changes render correctly, you can build and preview the site on your local system using Hugo.
One great thing about Hugo is that it has a live preview mode. In live preview mode, Hugo spawns a web server that detects content updates in the tree and will render Markdown to HTML in real time. This means you can see the updated content and layout in real time as you edit!


###Install HUGO:
**Note 1:** On OS X, if you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), installation is even easier: just run `brew install hugo`.


**Note 2:** Hugo requires Go 1.4+. If Go is not already installed on your system, you can [get it here](https://golang.org/dl/).

Now install Hugo:
```
go get -u -v github.com/spf13/hugo
```

Clone your forked copy of the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GIT USERNAME>/nats-site.git
```

Change to the directory:
```
cd nats-site/
```

Get the NATS HUGO theme

If you you want to modify the NATS theme, fork the [NATS theme](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-theme), then `git clone` your forked repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/nats-theme.git themes/nats
```
If you just want the theme for presentation while you make changes, you can just clone the [NATS theme](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-theme) directly.
```
git clone git@github.com:nats-io/nats-theme.git  themes/nats
```

Build the site and start the server:
```
hugo server -w --port=1414 --theme=nats --buildDrafts
```
