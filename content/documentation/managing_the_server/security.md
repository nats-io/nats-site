As of Release 0.7.0, the server can use modern TLS semantics for client connections, route connections, and the HTTPS monitoring port. To enable TLS on the client port add the TLS configuration section as follows:

```ascii
# Simple TLS config file

listen: 127.0.0.1:4443

tls {
  cert_file:  "./configs/certs/server-cert.pem"
  key_file:   "./configs/certs/server-key.pem"
  timeout:    2
}

authorization {
  user:     derek
  password: $2a$11$W2zko751KUvVy59mUTWmpOdWjpEm5qhcCZRd05GjI/sSOT.xtiHyG
  timeout:  1
}
```

Note: This TLS configuration is also used for the monitor port if enabled with the `https_port` option.

The server **requires** a certificate and private key. Generating self signed certs and intermediary certificate authorities is beyond the scope here, but this document can be helpful in addition to Google Search:
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/articles/https/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/engine/articles/https/</a>

The server can be run using command line arguments to enable TLS functionality.

```
--tls                        Enable TLS, do not verify clients (default: false)
--tlscert FILE               Server certificate file
--tlskey FILE                Private key for server certificate
--tlsverify                  Enable TLS, verify client certificates
--tlscacert FILE             Client certificate CA for verification
```

Examples using the test certificates which are self signed for localhost and 127.0.0.1.

```sh
> ./nats-server --tls --tlscert=./test/configs/certs/server-cert.pem --tlskey=./test/configs/certs/server-key.pem

```

Notice that the log indicates that the client connections will be required to use TLS. If you run the server in Debug mode with -D or -DV, the logs will show the cipher suite selection for each connected client.

```sh

```

### TLS Ciphers

The server requires TLS version 1.2, and sets preferences for modern cipher suites that avoid those known with vulnerabilities. The
server's default preferences when building with Go1.5 are as follows.

```go
func defaultCipherSuites() []uint16 {
  return []uint16{
    // The SHA384 versions are only in Go1.5+
    tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
    tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
    tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,
    tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,
    tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
    tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
  }
}
```

Optionally if your organization requires a specific cipher or list of ciphers, you can configure them with the `cipher_suites` option as follows:

```ascii
tls {
  cert_file:  "./configs/certs/server.pem"
  key_file:   "./configs/certs/key.pem"
  timeout: 2
  cipher_suites: [
    "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
    "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
  ]
}
```

A list of supported cipher suites is [located here in the cipherMap variable](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/blob/master/server/ciphersuites.go#L21).

### Client TLS Mutual Authentication

Optionally the server can require that clients need to present certificates, and the server can be configured with a CA authority to verify the client certificates. Simply add the option `verify` the TLS configuration section as follows:

```ascii
tls {
  cert_file: "./configs/certs/server-cert.pem"
  key_file:  "./configs/certs/server-key.pem"
  ca_file:   "./configs/certs/ca.pem"
  verify:    true
}
```

If you want the server to enforce and require client certificates as well via the command line, utilize this example.

```sh
> ./nats-server --tlsverify --tlscert=./test/configs/certs/server-cert.pem --tlskey=./test/configs/certs/server-key.pem --tlscacert=./test/configs/certs/ca.pem
```

This option simply verifies the client's certificate has been signed by the CA specified in the `ca_file` option. However, it does not map any attribute of the client's certificate to the user's identity.

To have TLS Mutual Authentication map certificate attributes to the users identity, replace the option `verify` with `verify_and_map` as shown as follows:

```ascii
tls {
  cert_file: "./configs/certs/server-cert.pem"
  key_file:  "./configs/certs/server-key.pem"
  ca_file:   "./configs/certs/ca.pem"
  # Require a client certificate and map user id from certificate
  verify_and_map: true
}
```

There are two options for certificate attributes that can be mapped to user names. The first is the email address in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of the certificate. While generating a certificate with this attribute is outside the scope of this document, we will view this with OpenSSL:

```ascii
$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in  test/configs/certs/client-id-auth-cert.pem
Certificate:
  -------------<truncated>-------------
        X509v3 extensions:
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
                DNS:localhost, IP Address:127.0.0.1, email:derek@nats.io
            X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
                TLS Web Client Authentication
  -------------<truncated>-------------
```

The configuration to authorize this user would be as follows:

```ascii
authorization {
  users = [
    {user: "derek@nats.io", permissions: { publish: "foo" }}
  ]
}
```

Note: This configuration only works for the first email address if there are multiple emails in the SAN field.

The second option is to use the RFC 2253 Distinguished Names syntax from the certificate subject as follows:

```ascii
$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in  test/configs/certs/tlsauth/client2.pem
Certificate:
    Data:
  -------------<truncated>-------------
        Subject: OU=CNCF, CN=example.com
  -------------<truncated>-------------
```

The configuration to authorize this user would be as follows:

```ascii
authorization {
  users = [
    {user: "CN=example.com,OU=CNCF", permissions: { publish: "foo" }}
  ]
}
```

### Cluster TLS Mutual Authentication

When setting up clusters all servers in the cluster, if using TLS, will both verify the connecting endpoints and the server responses. So certificates are checked in both directions. Certificates can be configured only for the server's cluster identity, keeping client and server certificates separate from cluster formation.

```ascii
cluster {
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4244

  tls {
    # Route cert
    cert_file: "./configs/certs/srva-cert.pem"
    # Private key
    key_file:  "./configs/certs/srva-key.pem"
    # Optional certificate authority verifying connected routes
    # Required when we have self-signed CA, etc.
    ca_file:   "./configs/certs/ca.pem"
  }
  # Routes are actively solicited and connected to from this server.
  # Other servers can connect to us if they supply the correct credentials
  # in their routes definitions from above.
  routes = [
    nats-route://127.0.0.1:4246
  ]
}
```

### Using bcrypt to Protect Passwords

In addition to TLS functionality, the server now also supports hashing of passwords and authentication tokens using `bcrypt`. To take advantage of this, simply replace the plaintext password in the configuration with its `bcrypt` hash, and the server will automatically utilize `bcrypt` as needed.

A utility for creating `bcrypt` hashes is included with the nats-server distribution (`util/mkpasswd.go`). Running it with no arguments will generate a new secure password along with the associated hash. This can be used for a password or a token in the configuration.

```
~/go/src/github.com/nats-io/nats-server/util> go get golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal
~/go/src/github.com/nats-io/nats-server/util> go build mkpasswd.go
~/go/src/github.com/nats-io/nats-server/util> ./mkpasswd
pass: #IclkRPHUpsTmACWzmIGXr
bcrypt hash: $2a$11$3kIDaCxw.Glsl1.u5nKa6eUnNDLV5HV9tIuUp7EHhMt6Nm9myW1aS
```

If you already have a password selected, you can supply the `-p` flag on the command line, enter your desired password, and a `bcrypt` hash will be generated for it:
```
~/go/src/github.com/nats-io/nats-server/util> ./mkpasswd -p
Enter Password: *******
Reenter Password: ******
bcrypt hash: $2a$11$3kIDaCxw.Glsl1.u5nKa6eUnNDLV5HV9tIuUp7EHhMt6Nm9myW1aS
```

Add the hash into the server configuration file's authorization section.

```
  authorization {
    user: derek
    password: $2a$11$3kIDaCxw.Glsl1.u5nKa6eUnNDLV5HV9tIuUp7EHhMt6Nm9myW1aS
  }
```
