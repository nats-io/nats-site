There are numerous ways to install the NATS server.

### Install From Binary

The latest official release binaries are always available on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd/releases). The following platforms are available:

* Linux (x86, x86_64, ARM)
* Windows (x86, x86_64)
* macOS

### Alternative/Platform Specific Methods

> **The following methods may not all install the latest released version**

#### Go

Make sure [your Go environment is set up](/doc/additional_documentation/go-install/), then install using `go get`.

```sh
go get github.com/nats-io/gnatsd
```

#### Docker Hub

The latest [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nats/) is available on Docker Hub.

#### Windows

On Windows, the NATS server can be installed via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/gnatsd):

```sh
choco install gnatsd
```

#### macOS

On macOS, the NATS server can be installed via [Homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/Gnatsd):

```sh
brew install gnatsd
```

### Test Your Installation

To test your installation, you can invoke the NATS server binary, with no options and no configuration file (no authentication, no clustering).

```sh
gnatsd
```

When the server starts successfully, you will see that the NATS server listens for client connections on TCP Port 4222:

```sh
[18141] 2016/10/31 13:13:40.732616 [INF] Starting nats-server version 0.9.4
[18141] 2016/10/31 13:13:40.732704 [INF] Listening for client connections on 0.0.0.0:4222
[18141] 2016/10/31 13:13:40.732967 [INF] Server is ready
```
