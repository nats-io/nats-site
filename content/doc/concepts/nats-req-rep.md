# NATS Request Reply

NATS supports two flavors of request reply messaging: point-to-point or one-to-many. Point-to-point involves the fastest or first to respond. In a one-to-many exchange, you set a limit on the number of responses the requestor may receive.

In a request-response exchange, publish request operation publishes a message with a reply subject expecting a response on that reply subject. You can request to automatically wait for a response inline.

The request creates an inbox and performs a request call with the inbox reply and returns the first reply received. This is optimized in the case of multiple responses.
