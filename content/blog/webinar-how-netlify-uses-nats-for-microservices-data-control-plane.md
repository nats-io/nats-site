**Speaker:** Ryan Neal, Head of Infrastructure at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

**When:** October 19, 2016 11:00AM PDT

Netlify is a platform for deploying high-performance websites and applications, serving up billions pageviews monthly for sites like: Uber, Vice Media, and Wikia to name a few.

Ryan discusses why they selected NATS, his experience with NATS for Netlify's data logging and control plane (for example using Logrus with a [NATS hook](https://github.com/netlify/messaging/blob/master/nats_logrus_hook.go), a connector for using [NATS with Elastic](https://github.com/netlify/elastinats), etc.).
