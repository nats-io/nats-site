One feature, released in the [v2.9.0 NATS server](https://nats.io/blog/nats-server-29-release/), that flew under the radar was the new `DiscardNewPerSubject` option on a stream. This blog post will describe this new feature as well as give a practical example of how it can be used to provide exactly-once message publication quality of service (QoS) through *infinite* deduplication that goes beyond the existing time-based deduplication feature of JetStream as well as many other streaming systems, such as Kafka.

In order to understand what this new feature is (bear with me here, as it introduces a subtle change in behavior) rather than just describe it, let me instead start by first describing one of the useful functionalities it enables.

## What can it do for you?

Starting at the highest level, as a developer we want a streaming service to be *perfect*. Perfection can mean many things, but it includes providing an 'exactly-once' quality of service such that, no matter what the failure scenario may be, the developer doesn't have to worry about handling and recovering from the failures that happen in production (i.e. services and application being restarted unexpectedly because of: crashes, upgrades, VM and containers being moved, etc...). 

There are two parts to the exactly-once streaming QoS equation: 'publish exactly-once' which is done through server side message deduplication, and reliable consumption on the subscriber's side (a separate subject of its own) which is done through acknowledgements, re-deliveries, and idempotent processing. 

## Why would you need it?

Message deduplication is very useful to deal with two kinds of stream publishing failure scenarios:

1. Protecting against the failure scenarios where a client application 'fails' before it gets an acknowledgement of its publication being successful or not. In those scenarios, the application will typically re-publish the same message again upon re-connecting or restarting, thereby resulting in duplication of the message in the stream. This scenario can happen when the client application gets disconnected, crashes, when the server or client application process (or VM or container/pod) gets moved, updated, restarted, etc. This potential for message duplication also gets exacerbated when publication acks are handled asynchronously (such as when high throughput is desired).

2. Protecting against failure scenarios in stream processing pipelines where the event processing is happening in a series of steps as messages representing the events being processed go through a number of streams (e.g. a message published on an upstream stream causes one or more messages to be published on one or more downstream streams). When there is a problem with one of the applications, somewhere in the pipeline, you can end up in a situation where some events can end up in a 'half-processed' state within the pipeline. In those scenarios, being able to recover the processing of those events simply by replaying the original the event messages from any point in the stream *without having to worry about duplicate message publishing* (and its possible side effects in any of the steps of the pipeline as a result of the replay) becomes a very desirable functionality.

## Can't you do that already?

Indeed, this is obviously not a new problem and there are already available functionalities to provide some kind of message deduplication in many streaming systems. All of them rely on the concept of *BYOID* (meaning you, the app developer, must bring your own unique ID for each of the event messages that you publish).

JetStream has a *time-scoped window* deduplication mechanism built-in. When enabled for a stream the NATS servers remember message IDs (specified in a header in the published messages) for a configurable period of time, which means that it applies regardless of client connections being dropped or client application processes being restarted as long as they reconnect within the period of time of the window.
Similarly, Kafka has a *connection-scoped window* deduplication mechanism built-in referred to as "producer idempotence." When enabled the brokers remember all the request IDs received from a client connection ID and detects retries, which means that the producer can only guarantee idempotence for messages sent within a single session.

As you can probably guess both methods have some clear limitations back in real-world production systems:

- The limitation of JetStream's stream deduplication window being that one can never tell ahead of time how much time it will actually take before a failing client process can be restarted and able to successfully process the messages in the stream.
- The limitation of Kafka's producer idempotence being that you can never guarantee that the application publishing will never crash or be killed before receiving the publication's acknowledgement and therefore publish a duplicate when it restarts. And even then you still need to persist the positive acknowledgements that you have received to some kind of external data store like Redis (so more than likely you are going to need to write and deploy something using Kafka Streams).

## What is the feature itself?

Now this finally brings us to the part where I describe the feature itself ðŸŽ‰

As the title of this blog implies, what this new feature of JetStream enables is the ability to have exactly-once publication through deduplication using BYOID over the entire stream, regardless of time between fault and restart, of client disconnections, or of the client or server processes getting restarted.

So, how do you actually use this new feature, and how does it work? Bear with me again as I first go through some prerequisite knowledge about stream limits and discard policies.

### Stream limits

JetStream allows you to set basic limits for a stream: the maximum number of messages in the stream, the maximum number of bytes, and the maximum amount of time you want the stream to keep messages (i.e. a TTL). Because it has the features that you would associate with a data store JetStream immediately enforces those limits. On the other hand, systems offering a distributed WAL feature set allow you to adjust when log compaction kicks in to prune the tail end of the stream data. More notably, log compaction functionality is completely independent from the ability to publish new messages for the topic.

### Discard policies

As a server enforces stream limits immediately on publication, like writing a new row into a database table as opposed to adding a record to a log, JetStream also allows you to specify a *discard policy*. This policy determines what happens to a published message when a limit is reached. There are two discard policies:

Discard `old` means that the oldest message(s) in the stream will be discarded in order to accept the new message being published while keeping the stream at the limit.

This discard policy satisfies the most common use-case which is a stream that has a rolling window of the newest messages while still controlling the size of the stream. It is, implicitly, the only kind of discard policy that you get when using a streaming system that only exposes WAL with log compaction functionality, as those systems are meant to always accept new messages or block until they can.

Discard `new` means that a message published to the stream will cause the server to return a "maximum messages exceeded" error if the message would take the stream over its max messages limit.

### Per-subject limits

So far, the limits described above apply at the *stream-level*, however JetStream also allows you to place a limit on the exact maximum number of messages *per subject* that can be stored in the stream at any given time.

## How do you use it?

The per-subject limit combined with the choice of discard policy applied at the subject-level means you can enforce a limit of *exactly one* message per subject. This enables many kinds of distributed logic coordination use cases, including the ability to have the streaming equivalent of using an `upsert`, `insert`, and `update` on a table with a unique ID constraint in SQL.

### Using Publish as an 'Upsert'

When the stream's discard policy is `old`, and you also have a per-subject limit of one, then it means a new message being published on subject `x` will always cause the automatic deletion of the message (if any) already stored in the stream with subject `x`.

When the stream's discard policy is `new`, and you also have a per-subject limit of one, then by default a new message on subject `x` will cause the automatic deletion of the message already stored in the stream for that subject. This is true even if the stream, as a whole, is at its stream limit. However, if the stream is at limit, a message received on a new subject will be rejected with "maximum messages exceeded".

With this behavior, one could say that the per-subject discard policy is _always_ `old`, regardless of the stream's discard policy being `new` or `old`. 

This is because it is the behavior you want for one of the most basic and common use cases of streaming: the ability to act as a *last message cache* so that subscribing applications immediately get an *initial value* (the current latest message published) for the subject(s) they are subscribing to, rather than having to wait an unknown period of time until the next publication on that (or these) subjects to get any data.

### Using Publish as an 'Insert'

However, and this was the new feature introduced in 2.9, JetStream also allows you to create streams with the `discard-new-per-subject` attribute which sets the _per subject_ discard policy to `new` when the stream's discard policy is also set to `new`.

So for example if you have set the steam's max messages per subject limit to 1 and there is already a message stored in the stream with that subject then the JetStream publish call fails immediately, just like an `insert` fails if there's already a row for that key in a table with a unique id constraint in SQL.

This in turns gives us infinite exactly-once publication quality of service, simply by including the unique id somewhere in the subject name. The *how* will be discussed.

### Using Publish as an 'Update'

While it is outside of the scope of this blog, for completeness, it is worth mentioning that JetStream can achieve a *compare-and-append* behavior (using the `Nats-Expected-Last-Subject-Sequence` message header) which can be used to implement an equivalent to `update` in SQL.

## How does it work?

The ability to strictly and consistently enforce this limit (a key attribute for our use case) is possible because of a fundamental difference between JetStream and distributed log streaming systems: JetStream is 'subject-based addressing aware', it allows you to capture messages on multiple subjects into a single stream, rather than having a hard equivalency of exactly one topic per stream. Of course other streaming systems also allow the publishing application to provide a *key* field along with the message being published to a topic, but the key is really meant to be only used for distribution (partitioning) purposes. But that is not the same thing as having the key(s) in the subject and then being able to use subject-based server-side (indexed) filtering consumers of the messages in a stream.

### Doesn't Kafka do this also?
And indeed, if you have experience with Kafka, this may look to you just like the "keep at least one message per key" log compaction feature, but there is a big difference: JetStream is exactly *n* maximum number of messages per subject while log compaction only ensures that you will have *at least one* message per key.

Besides the potential inefficiency (i.e. having to scan the whole stream to be sure to get the latest message for a specific key in the last message cache) you will not be able to use a streaming WAL functionality to enforce a strict per key limit, and to signal the client application publishing a message immediately when the publication would break the limit. This is why there is no concept of a `new` discard policy in distributed log streaming systems, they are designed and optimized for always accepting new messages or block until they can.

## How do I play with it?
Congratulations, you have now reached the practical exercise walk through part of this blog and you can test this for yourself using the `nats` CLI tool!

A prerequisite is access to a JetStream-enabled NATS server (e.g. running `nats-server -js` locally) and having the `nats` CLI context pointing to it.

First let's create the stream:
```
nats stream add dedup --discard-per-subject
```
Specify a subject filter of your choice, it needs to have at least one `*` (or a `>`) wildcard for the subject token(s) where the unique id is located. In this example `foo.*`.

You can select what you want for the other parameters, or just hit return to use the defaults, as long as you set the "Per subject Messages Limit" to `1`, and the stream's discard policy to `new` (as this new discard per subject is not relevant to the `old` stream discard policy).

Let's do a JetStream publish of a message for id=1
```
nats req foo.1 one
``` 
Which is successful (here the message is assigned sequence number 1):
```
17:08:57 Sending request on "foo.1"
17:08:57 Received with rtt 284.958Âµs
{"stream":"dedup", "seq":1}
```
Let's publish another message, for id=2
```
nats req foo.2 one
```
Which is also successful (and assigned sequence number 2):
```
17:09:03 Sending request on "foo.2"
17:09:03 Received with rtt 267.584Âµs
{"stream":"dedup", "seq":2}
```
Now let's try to publish another message for id=1
```
nats req foo.1 two
```
Which fails, thereby ensuring message deduplication:
```
17:09:11 Sending request on "foo.1"
17:09:11 Received with rtt 192.709Âµs
{"error":{"code":503,"err_code":10077,"description":"maximum messages per subject exceeded"},"stream":"dedup","seq":0}
```
At this point we can for example remove the existing message for id=2 using its sequence number (2 in this example)
```
nats stream rmm dedup 2
```
And attempt to publish a new message for id=2
```
nats req foo.2 two
```
Which works:
```
17:09:52 Sending request on "foo.2"
17:09:52 Received with rtt 318.125Âµs
{"stream":"dedup", "seq":3}
```

## Closing thoughts

To review, the new discard policy *discard-new-per-subject* enables the ability to have an 'infinite deduplication window' to avoid duplicated publications that can otherwise happen to some failure scenarios.

This new ability is specific to JetStream due to its fundamental functional differences compared to other distributed streaming systems: it is subject-based addressing capable and has the features of a proper data store (rather than just the features of an append-only log with compaction). The functionality is built-in to NATS server itself rather than something you have to implement and deploy separately (e.g. Kafka Streams processes) and requires an external data store (e.g. Redis). 

Ensuring message deduplication is also not the only use for this new feature: it can effectively be used for any kind of (optimistic) distributed processing concurrency access control (e.g. forms of locks, semaphores, logic gating, etc...), and you can combine it with message TTL to automatically clear the lock after some time. Other use cases include:

- N workers need to perform an action at most once/twice/thrice per period
- Given 1000s of workers only an N subset should be able to do something concurrently

Finally, do remember that 'nothing comes for free': just like a proper data store should, JetStream uses indexing to ensure that it doesn't have to scan the entire stream to find any existing message with a matching subject. This means that the more individual subjects you have in a stream, the more the overhead (i.e. memory) taken up on the servers for this indexing. It doesn't mean that the existing time-based message deduplication window feature is not needed anymore, as there are some use cases where it may be better suited than using a per-subject limit.
