**Speaker**: Alberto Ricart, Principal Engineer, NATS

**When**: August 30, 2016


Regardless of if you are interested in architecting an IoT network, moving a monolithic application to a microservices approach, or building cloud native applications, the majority of messaging systems were not designed with these paradigms in mind.

Modern systems require a messaging infrastructure built for the scale, flexibility, and speed of todayâ€™s distributed systems.

The webinar will cover:

- The basics of messaging patterns
- Why traditional messaging systems are not well suited for modern distributed systems
- What makes NATS different

With that foundational info out of the way, we will lead into a fun demo inspired by Pokemon Go, showing how NATS could be use to enable real-time microservices at large scale.
