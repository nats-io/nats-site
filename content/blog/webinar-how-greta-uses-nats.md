[Greta](http://www.greta.io) is a Swedish startup that wants to change the way content is delivered on the internet. Their team has developed a technology for peer-to-peer content delivery over webRTC, which uses NATS to create a rapid, highly scalable webRTC signaling system.

[Dennis Mårtensson](https://twitter.com/dennis_marten), Co-Founder and CTO at Greta, will give an overview and answer questions, and we are excited to hear from him!
