# Hello World with the NATS Java Library

Recently, stream functionality was added to the NATS server in release 2.2. See our [JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/jetstream/jetstream) section in docs for additional information.

Check out this video where I discuss the basics of how to create a stream and then publish and consume messages 
using the [NATS Java client](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.java).
