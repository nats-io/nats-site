The NATS Team has worked hard to create numerous code examples across six different 
client languages that illustrate how to use supported NATS clients. We believe the 
new documentation will provide a better experience for those starting to use NATS 
by demonstrating usage of the client API and its best practices. A super neat feature 
is that all samples are in the same documentation page. You can click on the language 
you want to view. This is a great way not only to learn about the client in the 
programming language you love most but also to learn how other clients do the same task.

We hope you enjoy the new documentation. Soon, we will be adding more programming 
languages and update server configuration pages to provide a similar experience. 
As always, let us know what you think and feel free to suggest or contribute examples 
you would like to see.

You can access the new documentation [here](https://www.nats.io/doc/).
