How good is software if you donâ€™t know how to use it? Documentation is needed no matter how simple to follow and 
easy to use you purport your code to be, and that is especially true with open source software.

The NATS Team has worked hard to improve and reorganize our documentation along with newly created code 
examples across six different client languages that illustrate how to use supported NATS clients. 
The new documentation will provide a better experience for those starting to use NATS by demonstrating 
usage of the client API and its best practices. 

Our favorite part of this new documentation? A super neat feature where all samples are in the same 
documentation page. Click the language tab you want to view and all examples cascade to show you numerous
examples in your preferred language. This is a great way not only to learn about the client in the 
programming language you love most but also to learn how other clients do the same task.

The team will be adding more programming languages and updating the server configuration pages to 
provide a similar experience. You can access the new examples in the documentation section of our 
website [https://www.nats.io/doc/](https://www.nats.io/doc/). For a sample on look and feel check 
out [this section](https://www.nats.io/doc/writing_applications/connecting/).

As always, please let us know what you think and feel free to suggest or contribute examples you would 
like to see using Github [https://github.com/nats-io/nats-site/issues] (https://github.com/nats-io/nats-site/issues).
