In this, the 3rd part of Dale Bingham's series on "Using NATS to Implement Service Mesh Functionality", Dale speaks about how to have similar service mesh benefits, usage and design when using the NATS messaging system as your communication backbone. As with anything dealing with software engineering, there are pros and cons to deciding on languages, infrastructure, and design models. It is always great to have alternatives and new ways of looking to solve problems.

This third article goes over the observability piece, or at least part of observability. We will see how the metrics, tracing, and alerting are done with respect to NATS in comparison to the similar functions you get with the major service meshes.
