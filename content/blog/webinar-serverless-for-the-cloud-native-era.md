Fission is a framework for serverless functions on Kubernetes, allowing users to deploy functions instantly with one command. There are no containers to build, and no Docker registries to manage. This emphasis on simplicity also requires a simple and scalable communication layer. This technical webinar will cover how the Fission platform works, and where NATS and Kubernetes fit in.
