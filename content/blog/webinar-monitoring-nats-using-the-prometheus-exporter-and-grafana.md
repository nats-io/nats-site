**When:** Wednesday, June 14th, 2017 10:00AM - 11:00AM PDT

Developers using NATS are looking for simplicity and performance in deploying their cloud native applications. As Prometheus and Grafana become increasingly popular, combining these technologies to monitor NATS has been a common request from our developer community. In May, we released a Prometheus exporter in beta. This webinar will give an overview of the exporter, and using this  with Grafana for monitoring.
