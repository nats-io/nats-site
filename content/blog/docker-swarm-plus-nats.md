For those of you who might have read the previous post I did on [Docker + NATS for Microservices](https://nats.io/blog/docker-compose-plus-nats/), youâ€™ll recall we took an in-depth look at using Docker Compose with NATS.

That blog post was done a few days prior to DockerCon, and as expected Docker made many interesting announcements at DockerCon. One of the main things announced [that week](https://blog.docker.com/2016/06/dockercon-2016-just-wow/) was Docker 1.12.

1.12 includes [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) which can be used for assembling a cluster of Docker Engines and running workloads on them.

In this blog post, we share a basic example of how showing some of these new features available in Docker 1.12 to bring up a NATS cluster that our clients running can then connect against.

## Requirements
+ Docker Engine 1.12
+ Docker Swarm cluster prepared with a manager and at least a couple of workers https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/
+ Latest release of the NATS Server, which supports cluster auto-discovery for clients. This way, if we add more nodes to the cluster the clients become aware of the full topology dynamically. Awesome stuff!

### Step 1

  We will first need to create an overlay network for the cluster, here named `nats-cluster-example`, along with an initial NATS server using latest Docker:

  ```
  docker network create --driver overlay nats-cluster-example

  docker service create --network nats-cluster-example \
                             --name nats-cluster-node-1 nats:0.9.4 -DV
  ```

### Step 2

  Next, we confirm which node of the Docker Swarm NATS Server ended up running on, and confirm its IP:

```
  docker service ps nats-cluster-node-1
  ID                         NAME                   IMAGE       NODE    DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE           ERROR
  b81qv4ljs7g7b52vmnlojktug  nats-cluster-node-1.1  nats:0.9.4  node-2  Running        Running 32 seconds ago

  docker network inspect nats-cluster-example
```

```json
  [
      {
          "Name": "nats-cluster-example",
          "Id": "944z42rg2hjwgsv9xubmomvi5",
          "Scope": "swarm",
          "Driver": "overlay",
          "EnableIPv6": false,
          "IPAM": {
              "Driver": "default",
              "Options": null,
              "Config": [
                  {
                      "Subnet": "10.0.1.0/24",
                      "Gateway": "10.0.1.1"
                  }
              ]
          },
          "Internal": false,
          "Containers": {
              "e0d105ed7703aa5de939861f75087671c96128fbe799bf6ba38cd15c55aaef07": {
                  "Name": "nats-cluster-node-1.1.0j0wde7hbqn735eqgpslkxowf",
                  "EndpointID": "e798782eaac9bbd36decf3c6e5defd56faa88a3c7a09df608ffd1f2ce1969ed8",
                  "MacAddress": "02:42:0a:00:01:03",
                  "IPv4Address": "10.0.1.3/24",
                  "IPv6Address": ""
              }
          },
          "Options": {
              "com.docker.network.driver.overlay.vxlanid_list": "258"
          },
          "Labels": {}
      }
  ]
```

  On node-2 of the Docker Swarm, notice that the NATS server is now running:

```
  docker logs e0b4d7b2f7f3
  [1] 2016/08/15 11:31:41.680139 [INF] Starting nats-server version 0.9.4

  [1] 2016/08/15 11:31:41.680348 [INF] Listening for client connections on 0.0.0.0:4222
  [1] 2016/08/15 11:31:41.680377 [DBG] Server id is JngwpOevXl1rhAovFO8Su6
  [1] 2016/08/15 11:31:41.680386 [INF] Server is ready
  [1] 2016/08/15 11:31:41.680731 [INF] Listening for route connections on 0.0.0.0:6222
```

### Step 3

Next, we will create another service which connects to this server within the overlay network; note that we have an initial IP for connecting to the server:

```ruby
docker service create --name ruby-nats --network nats-cluster-example wallyqs/ruby-nats:ruby-2.3.1-nats-v0.8.0 -e '
  NATS.on_error do |e|
    puts "ERROR: #{e}"
  end
  NATS.start(:servers => ["nats://10.0.1.3:4222"]) do |nc|
    inbox = NATS.create_inbox
    puts "[#{Time.now}] Connected to NATS at #{nc.connected_server}, inbox: #{inbox}"

    nc.subscribe(inbox) do |msg, reply|
      puts "[#{Time.now}] Received reply - #{msg}"
    end

    nc.subscribe("hello") do |msg, reply|
      next if reply == inbox
      puts "[#{Time.now}] Received greeting - #{msg} - #{reply}"
      nc.publish(reply, "world")
    end

    EM.add_periodic_timer(1) do
      puts "[#{Time.now}] Saying hi (servers in pool: #{nc.server_pool}"
      nc.publish("hello", "hi", inbox)
    end
  end
'
```
### Step 4

Now we are ready to add more nodes to the cluster via more `docker services`:

```
docker service create --network nats-cluster-example \
			   --name nats-cluster-node-2 nats:0.9.4 -DV -cluster nats://0.0.0.0:6222 -routes nats://10.0.1.3:6222
```

Add in more replicas of the subscriber:

```
docker service scale ruby-nats=3
```

Then confirm the distribution on our Docker Swarm cluster:

```
docker service ps ruby-nats
ID                         NAME         IMAGE                                     NODE    DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE          ERROR
25skxso8honyhuznu15e4989m  ruby-nats.1  wallyqs/ruby-nats:ruby-2.3.1-nats-v0.8.0  node-1  Running        Running 2 minutes ago  
0017lut0u3wj153yvp0uxr8yo  ruby-nats.2  wallyqs/ruby-nats:ruby-2.3.1-nats-v0.8.0  node-1  Running        Running 2 minutes ago  
2sxl8rw6vm99x622efbdmkb96  ruby-nats.3  wallyqs/ruby-nats:ruby-2.3.1-nats-v0.8.0  node-2  Running        Running 2 minutes ago  
```

The sample output after adding more NATS server nodes to the cluster, is below - and notice that the client is dynamically aware of more nodes being part of the cluster via auto discovery!:

```
[2016-08-15 12:51:52 +0000] Saying hi (servers in pool: [{:uri=>#<URI::Generic nats://10.0.1.3:4222>, :was_connected=>true, :reconnect_attempts=>0}]
[2016-08-15 12:51:53 +0000] Saying hi (servers in pool: [{:uri=>#<URI::Generic nats://10.0.1.3:4222>, :was_connected=>true, :reconnect_attempts=>0}]
[2016-08-15 12:51:54 +0000] Saying hi (servers in pool: [{:uri=>#<URI::Generic nats://10.0.1.3:4222>, :was_connected=>true, :reconnect_attempts=>0}]
[2016-08-15 12:51:55 +0000] Saying hi (servers in pool: [{:uri=>#<URI::Generic nats://10.0.1.3:4222>, :was_connected=>true, :reconnect_attempts=>0}, {:uri=>#<URI::Generic nats://10.0.1.7:4222>, :reconnect_attempts=>0}, {:uri=>#<URI::Generic nats://10.0.1.6:4222>, :reconnect_attempts=>0}]
```

Sample output after adding more workers which can reply back (since ignoring own responses):

```
[2016-08-15 16:06:26 +0000] Received reply - world
[2016-08-15 16:06:26 +0000] Received reply - world
[2016-08-15 16:06:27 +0000] Received greeting - hi - _INBOX.b8d8c01753d78e562e4dc561f1
[2016-08-15 16:06:27 +0000] Received greeting - hi - _INBOX.4c35d18701979f8c8ed7e5f6ea
```

## Conclusion

Built-in Docker Swarm mode in Docker Engine can be very handy for deploying a distributed system where NATS is being used for handling the internal communication among components via an overlay network, and external communication is being exposed through a load balancer. This in combination with the cluster discovery features from latest NATS releases make microservices operations a breeze, and incredibly flexible and scalable.
